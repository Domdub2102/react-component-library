The React component library is a collection of components written to be fully reusable and customisable by the user (ie. a developer). 

This is a solo project to be completed upon the completion of the first section of the "Advanced React" course created by Bob Ziroll on Scrimba.

Below is the original README text provided by the developers at Scrimba:

At Scrimba our goal is to create the best possible coding school at the cost of a gym membership! ðŸ’œ
If we succeed with this, it will give anyone who wants to become a software developer a realistic shot at succeeding, regardless of where they live and the size of their wallets ðŸŽ‰
The Frontend Developer Career Path aims to teach you everything you need to become a Junior Developer, or you could take a deep-dive with one of our advanced courses ðŸš€
